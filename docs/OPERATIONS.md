# Operations Runbook

## Deploy checklist by target

### Cloudflare Pages (`.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml`)
- Confirm CI passed on the target commit.
- Confirm `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are available in Actions.
- Confirm Pages project name variable is set (or default `mechpro-dispatch` is intended).
- Run/verify `npm ci`, `npm run build:web`, and `npm run stage:pages`.
- Validate `/` and `/api/healthz` after deployment.

### Cloudflare Worker (`worker/`, `wrangler.jsonc`)
- Confirm `wrangler.jsonc` bindings and `database_id` are correct for target environment.
- Apply migrations (`npm run db:migrate:remote`) before traffic-sensitive changes.
- Deploy (`npm run deploy:worker`) and verify Worker logs/health.

### Cloudflare R2 (`.github/workflows/deploy-r2.yml`)
- Confirm R2 credentials and bucket variable/secret are configured.
- Confirm upload artifact path is present before upload step.
- Verify object key and retrieval from bucket after upload.

### Android APK (`.github/workflows/android-apk.yml`, `android/`)
- Confirm Node/Java/Android SDK steps are green in workflow.
- Confirm `npm run sync` completed before Gradle build.
- Verify `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` artifact upload.

### Windows Desktop (`.github/workflows/windows-desktop.yml`, `desktop/`)
- Confirm J2534 host publish artifact exists before installer build.
- Confirm desktop build dependencies installed via `npm ci`.
- Validate generated `.exe` and `.zip` artifacts and release upload step.

## Rollback checklist
- Identify last known good commit/workflow run for affected target.
- Re-run deploy workflow at last known good commit or redeploy prior artifact.
- For Worker regressions, redeploy previous Worker bundle and confirm `/api/healthz`.
- For Pages regressions, redeploy previous staged static assets.
- For R2 object regressions, restore previous object version/key.
- Record rollback timestamp, commit SHA, and incident notes.

## Post-deploy smoke test checklist
- Open web app root and confirm shell loads without console errors.
- Hit `GET /api/healthz` and confirm expected JSON response.
- Validate one authenticated app flow relevant to the deploy.
- Validate one offline/local-first flow still works.
- Validate platform-specific artifact availability (APK/Windows installer) when released.

## Incident triage basics
- Capture: impact, start time, affected targets (Pages/Worker/R2/Android/Windows), and latest deploy SHA.
- Check GitHub Actions run logs for failing step and first error.
- Check Cloudflare dashboard logs (Worker, Pages, R2 access patterns) for correlated failures.
- Verify required secrets/vars still exist and were not rotated incorrectly.
- Mitigate fast (rollback or feature toggle), then document root cause and follow-up tasks.
