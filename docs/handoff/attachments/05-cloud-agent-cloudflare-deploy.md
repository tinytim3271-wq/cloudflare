## Launch prompt (summary)

Full production deploy of MechPro Cloudflare Pages project `tinytim3271-wq/cloudflare` (Pages `mechpro-dispatch`). Prompt described hybrid SPA on Pages with API on AWS; agent later noted `main` actually uses Cloudflare Worker/D1/R2/Workers AI.

## Major status updates (verbatim excerpts)

### Architecture mismatch note

The current repository does not match the requested hybrid architecture: `main` is configured for a same-origin Cloudflare Worker/D1/R2/Workers AI backend, and its release workflow deploys that backend before Pages. I’m checking the failed `main` run and repository history now so the production deploy does not accidentally replace an AWS-backed SPA with a different backend model.

### CI token failure / site already serving main

The latest `main` workflow validated successfully but publishing stopped on Cloudflare API authentication (`Invalid access token`, code `9109`) during D1 migration. The static production site nevertheless already serves the exact `app.js` committed at `main` SHA `6e3bc8e…`; I’m now running the official Node 24 build/validation and checking the full staged Pages surface against production.

### Final report

Production Pages is live at https://mechpro-dispatch.pages.dev, serving the bundle from `main` commit `6e3bc8e9c409e02bec89d447ea9fa02ada7d676c`.

- Owner’s authenticated Windows deployment is the working publish path.
- PR [#21](https://github.com/tinytim3271-wq/cloudflare/pull/21) adds clearer token-failure diagnostics and rotation documentation.
- All PR checks pass. Node 24 build, 17 Worker tests, staging, and Wrangler dry-run pass.
- Rotate `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=0c31efca6f8739ca301b222f3d68cff4` in the `production` Actions environment.
- Current `main` uses Cloudflare Worker/D1/R2/Workers AI—not the described AWS hybrid backend.
- Aikido scanning was unavailable because its MCP integration is not configured.

## Parent Grok Bot’s parallel local deploy conclusion (from Timothy chat)

Live from Lees_computer Wrangler (`lee@yourcarguy806.com`): Worker `mechpro-api`, Pages `mechpro-dispatch`, `https://www.yourcarguy806.com/` 200, `/api/healthz` → `{"ok":true,"service":"mechpro-cloudflare-api"}`. CI token still needs rotation.
