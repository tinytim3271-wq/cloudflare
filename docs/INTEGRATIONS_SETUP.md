# MechPro integration setup

All integrations run from the existing Cloudflare Worker. Do not put credentials
in `wrangler.jsonc`, source control, Pages variables, or browser storage. Set
production credentials with `wrangler secret put NAME`; use `.dev.vars` only
for local development. Apply D1 migrations before enabling webhooks.

## Licensed labor guides

MechPro supports MOTOR and ALLDATA through a provider-neutral adapter. Until a
licensed provider returns an operation, labor remains editable and is shown as
**Unverified shop estimate**. A response is never marked verified merely
because an endpoint was configured.

Timothy must:

1. Ask MOTOR Information Systems for a MOTOR Data as a Service/API license that
   permits labor-time display inside a shop-management product, including
   multi-tenant resale if MechPro will serve other shops.
2. Ask ALLDATA for approved API/partner access and the same display/resale
   rights. Their normal web subscription is not automatically an API license.
3. Obtain the provider's base URL, labor-search path, authentication scheme,
   request contract, attribution requirements, and production approval.
4. Configure one or both providers:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MOTOR_LABOR_BASE_URL` | MOTOR API origin |
| `MOTOR_LABOR_SEARCH_PATH` | Relative labor search path |
| `MOTOR_LABOR_API_KEY` / `MOTOR_LABOR_TOKEN` | Provider credential |
| `MOTOR_LABOR_AUTH_HEADER` / `MOTOR_LABOR_AUTH_SCHEME` | Optional non-default auth |
| `MOTOR_LABOR_SEARCH_METHOD` | `POST` (default) or `GET` |
| `ALLDATA_LABOR_*` | ALLDATA equivalents |
| `LABOR_PROVIDER` | Optional preferred provider: `motor` or `alldata` |
| `LABOR_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional timeout, 100–30000 ms |

The adapter deliberately does not guess private vendor paths. Update the
configuration to the contract supplied during onboarding.

## PartsTech and Nexpart

Timothy must create/approve PartsTech and WHI/Epicor Nexpart partner accounts
and request credentials for each contracted capability. Search, quote, order,
and punch-out are independently enabled so MechPro does not claim an operation
the contract does not include.

For each `PARTSTECH` or `NEXPART` prefix configure:

- `_BASE_URL`, `_API_KEY` or `_TOKEN` (or `_USERNAME` + `_PASSWORD`)
- `_SEARCH_PATH`, `_QUOTE_PATH`, `_ORDER_PATH`, `_STATUS_PATH` as supplied
- `_PUNCHOUT_URL` when the supplier provides a hosted catalog
- Optional per-operation `_METHOD`, `_AUTH_HEADER`, and `_AUTH_SCHEME`
- Optional global `PARTS_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS`

AutoZone Pro remains available and unchanged. Never provide supplier passwords
to browser code; the Worker sends API credentials server-side.

## Built-in SMS with Twilio

1. Create a Twilio account owned by the business.
2. Buy/port an SMS-capable US number or assign one to a Messaging Service.
3. Complete brand and campaign registration for A2P 10DLC. Describe estimate
   approvals, repair-status updates, pickup notices, and payment links; provide
   the opt-in workflow and sample messages.
4. Configure:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` (recommended) or `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`
   - `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL`, exactly matching the signed inbound URL:
     `https://HOST/api/messaging/twilio/webhook/SHOP_ID`
5. Set that URL as the incoming-message webhook for the number.

Inbound and outbound messages are stored in D1. Exact STOP-family messages mark
the number opted out and block MechPro sends; START/UNSTOP restores consent.
Twilio may also enforce its own opt-out list. Do not send marketing traffic
under the transactional campaign. Keep documented consent and honor quiet
hours. The feature is hidden/disabled when credentials are absent.

Estimate approval links, ready-for-pickup notices, and Stripe-hosted
text-to-pay links use the same sender. Payment card data never passes through
SMS or MechPro.

## QuickBooks Online

1. Create an app at the Intuit Developer portal and enable the
   `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` scope.
2. Add the exact redirect URI
   `https://HOST/api/quickbooks/callback` (and the local Wrangler URI for
   sandbox testing).
3. Configure `INTUIT_CLIENT_ID`, `INTUIT_CLIENT_SECRET`,
   `INTUIT_REDIRECT_URI`, and `INTUIT_ENVIRONMENT` (`sandbox` first, then
   `production` after Intuit review).
4. Configure `INTUIT_DEFAULT_ITEM_ID` to an active QuickBooks Service item used
   when a MechPro invoice has no item mapping.
5. An admin connects from **Integrations**. OAuth state and PKCE verifier data
   are short-lived; access and refresh tokens are encrypted in D1 using
   `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

Current synchronization is one-way MechPro → QBO for customers, invoices, and
payments. Sync metadata prevents losing the QBO ID. This does not import edits
from QBO or perform accounting reconciliation; verify the sandbox company
before production use.

## Stripe SaaS subscription billing

This is the MechPro platform subscription, separate from each shop's Stripe
account used to collect customer invoices.

1. In the platform Stripe account create products and recurring USD prices:
   - Solo: $69 monthly; $690 annual
   - Shop: $139 monthly; $1,390 annual
   - Shop Pro: $279 monthly; $2,790 annual
   - Enterprise: $559 monthly; $5,590 annual
   - Founding Solo: $49 monthly; $490 annual
   - Founding Shop: $99 monthly; $990 annual
   - Founding Pro: $199 monthly; $1,990 annual
2. Founding prices must not be publicly selectable; they remain invite-only.
3. Enable Stripe Billing customer portal cancellation/payment-method features.
4. Create a webhook for `https://HOST/api/billing/webhook` subscribing to:
   `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`,
   `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, and
   `invoice.payment_failed`.
5. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and every
   `STRIPE_PRICE_<PLAN>_MONTHLY` / `_ANNUAL` variable listed in
   `.dev.vars.example`.

Checkout fails closed if a real configured Price ID is absent. Webhooks are
signature-checked and idempotently stored in `billing_events`; subscription
status and plan capabilities update from lifecycle events.

## Support

Set `SUPPORT_EMAIL_TO`, `SUPPORT_EMAIL_FROM`, and optionally
`STATUS_PAGE_URL`. `SUPPORT_EMAIL_FROM` must be allowed by the existing
Cloudflare Email Routing `EMAIL` binding. Tickets are always stored in D1 even
if email delivery is unavailable; the API reports notification status.

## Deployment checklist

1. Configure and test every provider in its sandbox.
2. Run `npm run db:migrate:local`, `npm run validate`, and security scanning.
3. Apply `npm run db:migrate:remote` only during an approved production change.
4. Add secrets with `wrangler secret put`; never paste values into a PR.
5. Confirm webhook signatures and replay/idempotency behavior.
6. Obtain Timothy's written approval for licenses, A2P campaign, Intuit app,
   Stripe catalog, support sender, and production activation.
